# TotalOSINT
TotalOSINT provides a centralised location for quickly retrieving the reputation of any IP address, domain or file hash using open source intelligence. 
This app will quickly retrieve a complete OSINT profile for the searched item - returning information from:

This returned information can then be saved and viewed at any time.
